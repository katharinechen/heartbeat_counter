#Heartbeat Counter 

##About
This program is written by Katharine Chen for a programming exercise for Bright.md. 

##Description
Given "heartbeat.sh", a sheel script that prints '*beat*' at random intervals, write a program that computes and periodically redisplays the current BPM heartrate. 

##Installation 
Clone this repository: 

````
git clone https://github.com/katharinechen/heartbeat_counter
````

Run the function as follows: 

````
bash heartbeat.sh | python beat_counter.py 
````

##Status 
This program is incomplete.  More specifically, the getting_input() is not functioning.  I am having trouble interacting with the shell stream.  As such, I wrote out the logic behind my functions so that you have some idea where I was going with my solution.
